# factor_graph [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cannon10100/factor_graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cannon10100/factor_graph)
An implementation of probabilistic factor graphs in Rust.

## Status
I'm still sketching out the general design of this library, so it'll be a while before things are up and running for inference. My first goal is to implement the **sum-product** and **max-sum** algorithms for factor graphs composed of only discrete variables.

## Documentation
See the generated Rust documentation [here](cannontwo.com/factor_graph).
